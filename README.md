# CodeMazeGuides
Code Maze is a blog about simplicity and pragmatism. We tend to write clear and simple articles, easily understandable by everyone.

We run a primarily C#/.NET (Core) blog, with some accent on web development and web applications. Besides trying to implement best practices and use the newest technologies available, we are focusing on the entire lifecycle of .NET (Core) applications.

We think that combination of a hands-on approach and focusing on the essence of the topic in our articles is what makes our blog unique. Hopefully, this approach will be something that helps you learn quicker and achieve the best results possible.

This repository contains most of the code from our blog.

Running the Examples
================
Each article is separated into its own folder on the repository and has its own solution. Whether you came from the article or just browsing the repository, each solution can be built separately with `dotnet build` or run with `dotnet run`.

On top of that most of the solutions contain additional tests you can browse and run with `dotnet test`. Tests usually serve to verify the solution, but you can often find some useful ideas and additional examples.
